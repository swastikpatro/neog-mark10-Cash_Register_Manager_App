# Mark-10 Cash Register App

This is a cash register app which tells the cashier/user rto return the amount in change to the excess money given by the customer in minimum number of notes.

## How it works ?

- Enter the bill amount
- Enter the money given by customer (if money given the customer is less than the bill Amount, a alert is popped ðŸ¤‘)
- If the customer pays excess money, the table shows with number of notes that the cashier needs to give back to the customer.
